## 💻 Used Technologies

### UI & Layout
- **HTML5**: Provides semantic structure for forms, task lists, and content sections, ensuring accessibility and SEO-friendly markup.  
- **CSS3 / Custom Styles**: Implements responsive layouts, theming, and smooth animations using modern CSS features.  
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: Accelerates UI development with a responsive grid, utility classes, and pre-styled components.  
- **Font Awesome**: Delivers scalable icons for actions like add, complete, delete, toggle, and install, enhancing visual clarity.  

### Logic & State Management
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**: Handles all client-side logic including task CRUD operations, filters, timers, theming, notifications, and animations in a modular structure (`app.js`, `filters.js`, `animations.js`, `pushNotificationsHandler.js`, `databaseManager.js`).  
- **IndexedDB (`idb` wrapper)**: Stores tasks locally in a persistent object store, enabling offline functionality and data retention across sessions.  
- **localStorage**: Saves user preferences such as theme (dark/light) and notification settings.  

### PWA & Browser APIs
- **Service Worker (PWA)**: Caches assets, serves offline and 404 pages, and implements a network-first with cache-fallback strategy for robust performance.  
- **Notifications API**: Sends optional browser notifications for overdue tasks, respecting user permissions.  
- **IntersectionObserver API**: Enables smooth scroll-reveal animations when elements enter the viewport.  

### Hosting
> **Frontend Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static hosting for the PWA).
